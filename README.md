### CKEditor5 inspcector

From V12 onwards CKEditor comes with a nifty [inspector](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/development-tools.html#ckeditor-5-inspector).
To enable it follow these steps:

1. Add a line to the `development.services.yml`: `ckeditor5_sections.enable_inspector: true`
2. Make sure to run `yarn install` in the `editor/`-subfolder to install it.
3. Rebuild caches `drush cr`.

Subsequently it will be attached automatically to all CKEditor5 instances.
